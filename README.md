## **Description**

**_Website Created using Squarespace to Give Users Access to Information and Events for Blessed Sacrament Parish_** <br/>
The Blessed Sacrament Parish (BSP) website was created using Squarespace and custom code injections to give it a more modern look. The website allows users to view different information about the Catholic church. This information includes, but is not limited to: Sacraments, Ministries, Becoming Catholic, Events, Staff, Contact, and Mass Times. The primary goal of the redesign was to restructure the information architecture and modernize the user interface of the church website.

This project was created using Squarespace, a website builder. Therefore, the structure and design of the project can be changed by logging in to Blessed Sacrament Parish's [Squarespace](https://account.squarespace.com/) account and selecting the project from the main dashboard page. The login credentials for BSP's Squarespace account credentials can be requested from the main parish office or the <b>Development & Communications</b> parish office. Note that the parish must authorize you before they grant you access to the Squarespace account to view/edit the structure of the parish website.

Read more about this project in the [Blessed Sacrament Parish Wiki](https://github.com/Andrew-EKrause/BSP-Squarespace-Website/wiki). Note that only users who have been granted access may read the Wiki.
